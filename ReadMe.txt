This is a two-part 2D space game built with OpenGL.

First, you act as the level designer, using your mouse to place obstacles (asteroids), collectibles (coins), and two types of power-ups (speed boost and invincibility) onto the game area.

Once you're ready, you press 'R' to start the game. You then pilot a spaceship with the keyboard, aiming to collect the items for points and temporary abilities, while dodging the obstacles you placed. The ultimate goal is to reach the moving portal at the top of the screen before the timer expires or you run out of lives.
